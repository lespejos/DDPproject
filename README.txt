Visualization aid for diagnostic test evaluation
Luis A. Espejo

Objective
Diagnostic test are no easy to understand and some of them are far from perfect. Estimations of the sensitivity and specificity of the diagnostic tests is available, but the uncertainty of these estimations cannot be easily obtained. This is an application to better understand diagnostic tests and the uncertainty associated to these tests. 

Development
Sensitivity, specificity and prevalence are plotted using a Beta distribution.  The parameters of the Beta distributions were calculated from the estimations of the mean and variance. Plots were built using simulations from the Beta distribution given the parameters. The mean and variance are inputted by the user using a sliding bar. Changes in the sensitivity, specificity and prevalence distribution can be observed along with the changes in the mean and variance estimations.
For individuals with diagnostic test results, the information of the sensitivity and specificity of the test is not really useful. In practical terms, the Positive and Negative Predicted Values have more importance, because they indicate the probability of infection given the diagnostic test results. Therefore the last tab of the application has the distributions of the positive and negative predicted values given the sensitivity, specificity and prevalence.

Use
This is an interactive application, where the users have to slide the bars to change the means and variances (inputs) and evaluate the changes in the distributions of the sensitivity, specificity prevalence and predicted values (output).
